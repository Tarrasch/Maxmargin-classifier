Max-margin classifier

This is a document that answers the questions in the.

Question 1:

    I implemented both classifiers, linearclassifier.m and mmclassifier.m.

    The results of running on the testdata is described below (in Q2)
    
Question 2:
   
    I've plotted and printscreened the plot. See plot_classifiers.png.

    The linearclassifier just outputs a garbage line, and it's easy to see
    in many ways. Firstly you see it on the plotted graph, secondly
    it puts delta = 1 and w to be very small. Therfor all equestion just say
    almost 0 >= 0, it's not exactly zeroes but rounding errors make it so.
    
    The max margin classifier with soft margins is however interesting.
    It's plotted as Q2 describes in the same screenshot plot_classifiers.png.
    
    To reproduce the graphs itself, just run linearclassier AND mmclassifier
    without clearing the graph inbetween.
